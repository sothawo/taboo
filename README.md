# taboo
a small collection of backend and frontend implementations for a bookmark service.

## purpose of this project

taboo - an abbreviation of _tagged bookmarks_ - is by no means a new idea as bookmarking services are abundant in the web.

The only purpose of this project is to develop such a service and to try different implementations of the backend - a REST service - with the latest technologies and specifications and to try different frontends.

So itâ€™s more a personal technology test and evaluation.

The project is split in the service and client directories and there in the different subprojects.
